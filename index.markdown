I am a recent MS graduate in Computer Science at ETH ZÃ¼rich. My research interests are large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL).  

Previously, I have completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I published a paper on Chinese-to-Cantonese neural machine translation and worked as a research intern on applying RL techniques to decode error correction codes at UCSD. During my master's studies, I published a paper on Federated Reinforcement Learning and I did my thesis on RL robotics at Flink Robotics.

In my free time, I enjoy playing racket sports (particularly squash and padel), chess games, and cooking.
